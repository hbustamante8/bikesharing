# bikesharing


## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Therefore, Tableau is used to demonstrate the analysis results through visuals. The Tableau workbook contains a story that walks through the important visuals that will help stakeholders understand what citybikes' success and engagement is in New York.

## Results

This indicates that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers and for leisure/exercise on Saturdays. There is confidence is successful ridesharing business in summer months in New York, however, further exploration is required to truly understand the seasonal changes as well as additional costs.


### Additional visualizations that should be explored
* Latittude and Longitude data for other months other than August. Especially winter months would be valuable to convince stakeholders to fund the proposal
