## Summary

### High-Level Summary
The data shows high activity for the month of August 2019. Citibike services in New York are highly profitable and all genders follow the same trend for bike usage.
Most rides occur in Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This indicates that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers and for leisure/exercise on Saturdays. There is confidence is successful ridesharing business in summer months in New York, however, further exploration is required to truly understand the seasonal changes as well as additional costs.


### Additional visualizations that should be explored
* Latitude and Longitude data for other months other than August. Especially winter months would be valuable to convince stakeholders to fund the proposal
* Bike defect data would be important to know. How many defects there are in bikes a year and costs associated with replacing bikes are important to understand.  
* Weather data visualizations would help establish the correlation between the weather and use of the bikes for transportation.
