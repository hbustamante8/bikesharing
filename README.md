# bikesharing


## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Therefore, Tableau is used to demonstrate the analysis results through visuals. The Tableau workbook contains a story that walks through the important visuals that will help stakeholders understand what citybikes' success and engagement is in New York.
